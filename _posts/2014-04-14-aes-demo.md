In the first chapter of show and tell stuff for this blog, I present to you a [small demo][aes-demo] of the inner workings of AES, the [Advanced Encryption Standard][aes-wiki]. AES is a widely deployed symmetric cypher (click on your browser's padlock and see). Its algorithm arranges the input (a 128-bit string) in a 4 Ã— 4 matrix. This is then transformed by four different basic operations, repeated during several rounds.

I tried to display these basic operations in the more suggestive way I could. The `MIX_COLUMNS` and `SUB_BYTES` were particularly difficult. I couldn't find a good metaphor for them beyond the fact that they affect a single column and a single byte respectively. If I have time I would like to add a flow chart similar to [this][aes-video]. That video is way more educational, but since I wrote the animations without any framework, I don't think I would have the patience to add so many features.

This experiment gave me a chance to play a little bit with Flexbox and CSS animations. In version 1.7, [Less](http://lesscss.org) introduced support for `@keyframes` declarations, which came really handy.

And that's it. Here it is [the demo link again][aes-demo], and the [repo link][aes-repo].
