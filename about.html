<h1>Should you hire me? <small><a class="hlink" href="https://careers.stackoverflow.com/rvidal">Who again?</a></small></h1>

<p>“Yes, of course you do!” Well, I have actually been on that side of the hiring process and it’s a tricky one indeed. Here there are a few odds and ends that don’t fit in my résumé.

<h2>Coding in the open</h2>

<p>Here be code written by yours truly. It undeniably proves that I don’t mix tabs and spaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a few <a href="https://github.com/eslint/eslint/commits?author=jrvidal">modest contributions</a> to <a class="project" href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>. It’s a wonderful project, it has a certain meta-programming aspect that I like a lot.</li>
<li>A silly web demo of the <a class="project" href="https://github.com/jrvidal/aes-demo">AES cipher</a>, and <a href="http://jrvidal.github.io/2014/04/14/aes-demo.html">some thoughts</a> about it.</li>
<li>A <a class="project" href="https://github.com/jrvidal/pylhef">LHEF parser</a> written in Python. “Parser” is a big word for it, as LHEF is a very simple (and horrible) format.</li>
<li>My <a class="project" href="https://github.com/jrvidal/goruden-boi">box of gists</a>, where I keep cool miscellany. It’s also an opportunity to experiment with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140212193422/http://ashkenas.com/literate-coffeescript/">literate programming</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning</h2>

<p>During my day job, I am a full-stack web developer. However, if you live in the web application layer as myself, you may have heard about other unfathomable layers, deep below ours. It is true, they exist. And that's what I do by night:

<ul>
<li><a class="project" href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs61c/sp14/">Computer Architecture</a></li>
<li><a class="project" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/comnetworks">Computer Networks</a></li>
<li><a class="project" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto">Cryptography I</a> *</li>
<li><a class="project" href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Ejrs/61bf06/">Data Structures</a></li>
<li><a class="project" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/gametheory">Game Theory</a> *</li>
<li><a class="project" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang">Programming Languages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(*) OK, not so related to CS, but who can resist?</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>I like that feeling when you crack a tough problem. I use that rush to teach me programming languages. Keep in mind that my solutions are not public (for good reasons!), but I can show them to you (not the prettiest code though):</p>

<ul>
<li><a class="project" href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>: I started one year ago, mostly using Python. As of today, I’m trying to break #100 (of +500!).</li>
<li><a class="project" href="http://cryptopals.com/">The Matasano Crypto Challenges</a>: crypto is amazing, <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> looks awesome, let’s do both at the same time. Progress: #27 of 56.</li>
<li><a class="project" href="https://microcorruption.com">Microcorruption</a>: really tough ones. Not that I’m <em>that</em> interested in MSP assembly but very rewarding. As of today, trying to break #17 of 17.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keep digging!</h2>

<p>I sometimes <a href="https://twitter.com/_rvidal">tweet about programming</a>, I sometimes <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1525398/rvidal">answer questions about programming</a>.
